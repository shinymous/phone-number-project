## Propose

This is an assessment project, the objective is to process a list of phone numbers taking into account several factors, including the country code.

Given a list of country codes (provided in attachment `coutryCodes.txt`) which includes a country code in each line, and an input file (`input.txt`) which includes a phone number in each line process the phone numbers according to the following rules:

A phone number is only valid if:

- It has 4 to 6 digits (inclusive) and is considered a `Short Number`
- It has 9 to 14 digits (inclusive) and is considered a `Long Number`
- A `Short Number` is a shortcut to a portuguese long number. A `Long Number` is a complete phone number that must include a country code (351, 44, etc)
- A `Short Number` cannot start with `0`
- A `Long Number` can start with or without a `+` character and the `+` character doesn't count for the 9 to 14 digits limit
- Alternatively a `Long Number` can start with a `00` if it doesn't start with a `+`. '00' also doesn't count for the 9 to 14 digits limit
- Numbers cannot have any letters or special characters like `/*-)(/#$` (or any other visible character), except for the `+` at the beginning of the number
- For a `Long Number`, no type of white space is allowed between the `+` and country code or between the `00` and country code, but any other whitespace is valid and it doesn't count as a character for the number limit
- A `Short Number` cannot have any type of white spaces
- A `Long Number` must have a valid country code, otherwise it's invalid

## Run

You can simply run the command on project root.
```bash
java -jar phone-number-project-jar-with-dependencies.jar input.txt
```

## OR 

To run the project you will need to generate the jar file

Run the following commands from project root
```bash
mvn clean package
```
Then move the "phone-number-project-jar-with-dependencies.jar" generated in the `target` directory to the directory of your choice
```bash
java -jar phone-number-project-jar-with-dependencies.jar input.txt
```

The jar automatically import the provided `countryCodes.txt` file placed next to the jar file

You can edit the `input.txt` file

## Output

For the output, a list of country names and the amount of numbers for that country ordered by descending amount of numbers will be displayed. Short numbers count as portuguese numbers. Example:

```text
United Kingdom:61
Spain:43
Vietnam:34
Portugal:27
... and so on
```

In this example the United Kingdom had 61 numbers on the input file, Spain had 43 and so on.

Some of the lines present in `countryCodes.txt` file:

```text
Afghanistan-93
Albania-355
Algeria-213
Andorra-376
Angola-244
Antarctica-672
```
